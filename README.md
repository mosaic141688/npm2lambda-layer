# npm2lambda-layer

Has this ever happen to you?

You just created you fresh nodejs lambda function and you need to use a package in npm. So you have to go through the proccess of installing you package an deploy it as a Lambda layer. That is a dauting taks but now you can just download the npm2layer.sh file, run it and you will have your npm module as a layer.
